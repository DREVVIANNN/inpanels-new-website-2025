            <strong>About Us</strong> <br>
            Welcome to the official website of DREVVIANN — a digital hub for all things content, creativity, and gaming. I’m a content creator best known for my TikTok videos centered around the action-packed world of Wuthering Waves.
            <br>
            As a TikToker, I create short-form content that dives into the mechanics, characters, lore, and hype of Wuthering Waves. Whether you're here for gameplay tips, reactions, theories, or cinematic edits, my content is made for fans who love the game as much as I do.
            <br>
            I started this journey as a casual gamer and video editor, but quickly found a growing audience who shared the same passion. What began as a fun hobby evolved into a full-time pursuit — and now, this website serves as my official platform to expand that connection.
            <br>
            Here, you’ll find exclusive updates, behind-the-scenes content, and extended versions of my TikToks. I’ll also share thoughts, guides, and personal takes on Wuthering Waves — the kind of content that doesn’t always fit into 60-second clips.
            <br>
            Beyond TikTok, I use this space to build a stronger community. This is where fans can interact directly, leave feedback, join future collaborations, and stay up to date with everything I'm working on — all in one place.
            <br>
            Wuthering Waves has become more than just a game for me — it’s a source of inspiration. From stunning visuals to rich storytelling, it constantly pushes me to be more creative with each new video. I’m excited to explore its evolving world with all of you.
            <br>
            I appreciate every like, comment, and share — but more than that, I appreciate the community we’re building. This site is a place for fans, friends, and future creators who want to grow together in a shared space.
            <br>
            If you're new here, welcome — and if you've been following my journey for a while, thank you. This site exists because of your support and engagement. Your encouragement fuels every post I make.
            <br>
            Feel free to explore, connect, and reach out. There’s much more to come, and I’m just getting started. Let’s ride the Wuthering Waves together — one video at a time.

            <strong>InPanels About</strong> <br>
            InPanels is a creative digital space built to support developers, designers, and creators who want to build, share, and grow together. Whether you're a solo coder, part of a project team, or someone just beginning your development journey, InPanels is designed with you in mind.
            <br>
            At its core, InPanels serves as both a community and a workspace. It offers a space where ideas become interactive projects, drafts become polished products, and individuals become part of something bigger. From landing pages to web applications, InPanels is where digital visions come to life.
            <br>
            The platform was founded by Drevviann, a creator with a passion for clean design, intuitive code, and collaborative development. His goal was simple: make a place where people can not only showcase their skills but also build them — together.
            <br>
            Unlike traditional dev communities that focus purely on questions and answers, InPanels encourages project-based learning. You don’t just talk about code here — you build with it. Community members can share components, templates, snippets, and even full UI layouts.
            <br>
            InPanels also includes tools for feedback and review, allowing users to collaborate in real-time, exchange thoughts on code quality, user experience, and design. This interactive element turns passive users into active contributors — a place where everyone’s work matters.
            <br>
            Whether you're working on a portfolio, an open-source utility, or just exploring ideas, InPanels offers a space for experimentation without judgment. There are no gatekeepers — just creators helping creators.
            <br>
            The platform also supports official verifications, giving recognition to trusted members and authentic developers. This helps maintain quality, trust, and transparency within the ecosystem — something InPanels values deeply.
            <br>
            One of the things that sets InPanels apart is its blend of technical and creative focus. It’s not just about what works — it’s about what feels good, looks clean, and performs well. Design and code go hand in hand here.
            <br>
            As InPanels continues to grow, we’re building more ways for developers to connect, learn, and launch. Our mission is clear: empower the next generation of creators to build not just better websites — but better digital communities.
            <br>
            Whether you're here to build, collaborate, learn, or simply get inspired, InPanels welcomes you. This is just the beginning — and your place in this journey is right here with us.
